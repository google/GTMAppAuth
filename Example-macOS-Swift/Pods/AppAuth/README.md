AppAuth for iOS and macOS is a client SDK for communicating with 
[OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and 
[OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) providers. 
It strives to
directly map the requests and responses of those specifications, while following
the idiomatic style of the implementation language. In addition to mapping the
raw protocol flows, convenience methods are available to assist with common
tasks like performing an action with fresh tokens.

It follows the best practices set out in 
[OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-native-apps)
including using `SFSafariViewController` on iOS for the auth request. For this
reason, `UIWebView` is explicitly *not* supported due to usability and security
reasons.

It also supports the [PKCE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) extension to
OAuth which was created to secure authorization codes in public clients when
custom URI scheme redirects are used. The library is friendly to other
extensions (standard or otherwise) with the ability to handle additional params
in all protocol requests and responses.

## Specification

### iOS

#### Supported Versions

AppAuth supports iOS 7 and above.

iOS 9+ uses the in-app browser tab pattern
(via `SFSafariViewController`), and falls back to the system browser (mobile
Safari) on earlier versions.

#### Authorization Server Requirements

Both Custom URI Schemes (all supported versions of iOS) and Universal Links
(iOS 9+) can be used with the library.

In general, AppAuth can work with any Authorization Server (AS) that supports
[native apps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-native-apps),
either through custom URI scheme redirects, or universal links.
AS's that assume all clients are web-based or require clients to maintain
confidentiality of the client secrets may not work well.

### macOS

#### Supported Versions

AppAuth supports macOS (OS X) 10.8 and above.

#### Authorization Server Requirements

AppAuth for macOS supports both custom schemes, a loopback HTTP redirects
via a small embedded server.

In general, AppAuth can work with any Authorization Server (AS) that supports
[native apps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-native-apps),
either through custom URI scheme, or loopback HTTP redirects.
AS's that assume all clients are web-based or require clients to maintain
confidentiality of the client secrets may not work well.

## Try

Want to try out AppAuth? Just run:

    pod try AppAuth

Follow the instructions in [Example/README.md](Example/README.md) to configure
with your own OAuth client (you need to update 3 configuration points with your
client info to try the demo).

## Setup

AppAuth supports three options for dependency management.

### CocoaPods

With [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html),
add the following line to your `Podfile`:

    pod 'AppAuth'

Then run `pod install`.

### Carthage

With [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), add the following
line to your `Cartfile`:

    github "openid/AppAuth-iOS" "master"

Then run `carthage bootstrap`.

### Static Library

You can also use AppAuth as a static library. This requires linking the library
and your project and including the headers.  Suggested configuration:

1. Create an XCode Workspace.
2. Add `AppAuth.xcodeproj` to your Workspace.
3. Include libAppAuth as a linked library for your target (in the "General ->
Linked Framework and Libraries" section of your target).
4. Add `AppAuth/Source` to your search paths of your target ("Build Settings ->
"Header Search Paths").

## Auth Flow

AppAuth supports both manual interaction with the Authorization Server
where you need to perform your own token exchanges, as well as convenience
methods that perform some of this logic for you. This example uses the
convenience method which returns either an `OIDAuthState` object, or an error.

`OIDAuthState` is a class that keeps track of the authorization and token
requests and responses, and provides a convenience method to call an API with
fresh tokens. This is the only object that you need to serialize to retain the
authorization state of the session.

### Configuration

You can configure AppAuth by specifying the endpoints directly:

```objc
NSURL *authorizationEndpoint =
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth"];
NSURL *tokenEndpoint =
    [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token"];

OIDServiceConfiguration *configuration =
    [[OIDServiceConfiguration alloc]
        initWithAuthorizationEndpoint:authorizationEndpoint
                        tokenEndpoint:tokenEndpoint];

// perform the auth request...
```

Or through discovery:

```objc
NSURL *issuer = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://accounts.google.com"];

[OIDAuthorizationService discoverServiceConfigurationForIssuer:issuer
    completion:^(OIDServiceConfiguration *_Nullable configuration,
                 NSError *_Nullable error) {

  if (!configuration) {
    NSLog(@"Error retrieving discovery document: %@",
          [error localizedDescription]);
    return;
  }

  // perform the auth request...
}];
```

### Authorizing – iOS

First you need to have a property in your AppDelegate to hold the session, in
order to continue the authorization flow from the redirect.

```objc
// property of the app's AppDelegate
@property(nonatomic, strong, nullable)
    id<OIDAuthorizationFlowSession> currentAuthorizationFlow;
```

And your main class, a property to store the auth state:

```objc
// property of the containing class
@property(nonatomic, strong, nullable) OIDAuthState *authState;
```

Then, initiate the authorization request. By using the 
`authStateByPresentingAuthorizationRequest` convenience method, the token
exchange will be performed automatically, and everything will be protected with
PKCE (if the server supports it). AppAuth also allows you to perform these
requests manually. See the `authNoCodeExchange` method in the included Example
app for a demonstration.

```objc
// builds authentication request
OIDAuthorizationRequest *request =
    [[OIDAuthorizationRequest alloc] initWithConfiguration:configuration
                                                  clientId:kClientID
                                                    scopes:@[OIDScopeOpenID,
                                                             OIDScopeProfile]
                                               redirectURL:KRedirectURI
                                              responseType:OIDResponseTypeCode
                                      additionalParameters:nil];

// performs authentication request
AppDelegate *appDelegate =
    (AppDelegate *)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;
appDelegate.currentAuthorizationFlow =
    [OIDAuthState authStateByPresentingAuthorizationRequest:request
        presentingViewController:self
                        callback:^(OIDAuthState *_Nullable authState,
                                   NSError *_Nullable error) {
  if (authState) {
    NSLog(@"Got authorization tokens. Access token: %@",
          authState.lastTokenResponse.accessToken);
    [self setAuthState:authState];
  } else {
    NSLog(@"Authorization error: %@", [error localizedDescription]);
    [self setAuthState:nil];
  }
}];
```

*Handling the Redirect*

The authorization response URL is returned to the app via the iOS openURL
app delegate method, so you need to pipe this through to the current
authorization session (created in the previous session).

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app
            openURL:(NSURL *)url
            options:(NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *)options {
  // Sends the URL to the current authorization flow (if any) which will
  // process it if it relates to an authorization response.
  if ([_currentAuthorizationFlow resumeAuthorizationFlowWithURL:url]) {
    _currentAuthorizationFlow = nil;
    return YES;
  }

  // Your additional URL handling (if any) goes here.

  return NO;
}
```

### Authorizing – MacOS

On macOS, the most popular way to get the authorization response redirect is to
start a local HTTP server on the loopback interface (limited to incoming
requests from the user's machine only). When the authorization is complete, the
user is redirected to that local server, and the authorization response can be
processed by the app. AppAuth takes care of managing the local HTTP server
lifecycle for you.

> #### :bulb: Alternative: Custom URI Schemes
> Custom URI schemes are also supported on macOS, but some browsers display
> an interstitial which reduces the usability. For an example on using custom
> URI schemes with macOS, See `Example-Mac`.

To receive the authorization response using a local HTTP server, first you need
to have an instance variable in your main class to retain the HTTP redirect
handler.

```objc
OIDRedirectHTTPHandler *_redirectHTTPHandler;
```

Then, as the port used by the local HTTP server varies, you need to start it
before building the authorization request in order to get the exact redirect
URI to use.

```objc
static NSString *const kSuccessURLString =
    @"http://openid.github.io/AppAuth-iOS/redirect/";
NSURL *successURL = [NSURL URLWithString:kSuccessURLString];

// Starts a loopback HTTP redirect listener to receive the code.  This needs to be started first,
// as the exact redirect URI (including port) must be passed in the authorization request.
_redirectHTTPHandler = [[OIDRedirectHTTPHandler alloc] initWithSuccessURL:successURL];
NSURL *redirectURI = [_redirectHTTPHandler startHTTPListener:nil];
```

Then, initiate the authorization request. By using the 
`authStateByPresentingAuthorizationRequest` convenience method, the token
exchange will be performed automatically, and everything will be protected with
PKCE (if the server supports it). By assigning the return value to the
`OIDRedirectHTTPHandler`'s `currentAuthorizationFlow`, the authorization will
continue automatically once the user makes their choice.

```objc
// builds authentication request
OIDAuthorizationRequest *request =
    [[OIDAuthorizationRequest alloc] initWithConfiguration:configuration
                                                  clientId:kClientID
                                              clientSecret:kClientSecret
                                                    scopes:@[ OIDScopeOpenID ]
                                               redirectURL:redirectURI
                                              responseType:OIDResponseTypeCode
                                      additionalParameters:nil];
// performs authentication request
__weak __typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
_redirectHTTPHandler.currentAuthorizationFlow =
    [OIDAuthState authStateByPresentingAuthorizationRequest:request
                        callback:^(OIDAuthState *_Nullable authState,
                                   NSError *_Nullable error) {
  // Brings this app to the foreground.
  [[NSRunningApplication currentApplication]
      activateWithOptions:(NSApplicationActivateAllWindows |
                           NSApplicationActivateIgnoringOtherApps)];

  // Processes the authorization response.
  if (authState) {
    NSLog(@"Got authorization tokens. Access token: %@",
          authState.lastTokenResponse.accessToken);
  } else {
    NSLog(@"Authorization error: %@", error.localizedDescription);
  }
  [weakSelf setAuthState:authState];
}];
```

### Making API Calls

AppAuth gives you the raw token information, if you need it. However we
recommend that users of the `OIDAuthState` convenience wrapper use the provided
`performActionWithFreshTokens:` method to perform their API calls to avoid
needing to worry about token freshness.

```objc
[_authState performActionWithFreshTokens:^(NSString *_Nonnull accessToken,
                                           NSString *_Nonnull idToken,
                                           NSError *_Nullable error) {
  if (error) {
    NSLog(@"Error fetching fresh tokens: %@", [error localizedDescription]);
    return;
  }

  // perform your API request using the tokens
}];
```
