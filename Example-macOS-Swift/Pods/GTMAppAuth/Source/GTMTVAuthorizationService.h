    @param initialization Block that is called with the initial authorization response. Unlike other
        OAuth authorization responses, the TV authorization response doesn't contain the
        authorization as the user has yet to grant it. Rather, it contains the information that you
        show to the user in order for them to authorize the request on another device.
    @param completion Block that is called on the success or failure of the authorization. If the
        user approves the request, you will get a @c GTMAppAuthFetherAuthorization that you can use
        to authenticate API calls, otherwis eyou will get an error.
    @return A block which you can execute if you need to cancel the ongoing authorization. Has no
        effect if called twice, or called after the authorization concludes.
